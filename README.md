# Library

As part of my Object-Oriented Programming course project at the faculty, I developed a C++ application using Qt for the GUI, focused on library management. This project not only enhanced my understanding of OOP principles, memory management, and design patterns like Observer and MVC but also provided practical experience in handling memory efficiently, including the effective use of pointers and applying the Rule of Three and Rule of Five.
